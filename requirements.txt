### Notes:

- The change to `backend/app/__init__.py` ensures both user and product databases are initialized.
- The table creation script is placed in `database/create_products_table.sql` to adhere to SQL file placement rules.
  
This completes the implementation of adding new products to the inventory and integrates it with the existing structure.
