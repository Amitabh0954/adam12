### Summary

This implementation of the shopping cart functionality ensures that:
- Shopping carts persist across sessions for logged-in users.
- Guest users can add products to the cart, but the cart will reset on session expiration.
- API endpoints are provided to handle shopping cart management.
- The MySQL database schema supports necessary fields for cart persistence.
