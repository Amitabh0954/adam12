To implement the feature allowing users to modify the quantity of products in their shopping cart, we need to ensure that quantity is always a positive integer and that the total price is recalculated whenever the quantity is modified.

### Implementation Plan:

1. **Extend `ShoppingCartService` to handle quantity modification**.
2. **Update the ShoppingCartController to include route for quantity modification**.
3. **Ensure routes are updated to include the new functionality**.
4. **Update the database schema if necessary to reflect any structural changes**.
