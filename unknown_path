To implement the password recovery functionality, ensuring that password reset links expire after 24 hours and users verify their identity via email, we need to follow these steps:

### Implementation Plan:

1. **Define the PasswordResetToken model.**
2. **Implement services for generating and validating password reset tokens.**
3. **Implement a controller to expose the API for password recovery.**
4. **Update routes to include the new password reset endpoint.**
5. **Update MySQL database schema to include the password reset token table.**
6. **Ensure this feature works by initializing it in the application.**
