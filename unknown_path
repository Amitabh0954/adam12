To implement the user login functionality with the constraints on invalid login attempts and session timeout after inactivity, we need to follow these steps:

### Implementation Plan:

1. **Define the models for User, UserSession, and LoginAttempt.**
2. **Implement services for user authentication and session management.**
3. **Implement a controller to expose the API for user login.**
4. **Update routes to include the new user login endpoint.**
5. **Update MySQL database schema to include the necessary tables.**
6. **Ensure this feature works by initializing it in the application.**

### Implementation:

#### 1. Define the models for User, UserSession, and LoginAttempt

##### User Model
Assuming this model is consistent with the previous registration functionality.

##### UserSession Model
