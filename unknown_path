To implement the product categorization feature based on the user story and the provided folder structure, we will handle categorization in the `product_catalog_management` module. This will involve creating a category model to manage categories, implementing services for managing categories, and updating the product model or service to ensure products can be categorized.

### Implementation Plan

1. **Create the Category model**: Define hierarchies and relationships.
2. **Update Product model** to include category relationships.
3. **Create a schema for managing categories**: `CategorySchema`.
4. **Implement category management service**: Service methods for creating, updating, and deleting categories.
5. **Implement the category management controller**: Controller for handling category requests.
6. **Update routes**: Include routes for managing categories and integrating with product routes.
7. **Ensure proper integration with the main application initialization**.
8. **Create the database schema for categories**.
