To implement shopping cart functionality, the following steps are necessary:

1. Define models for the shopping cart and cart items.
2. Create views to manage the shopping cart (adding items to it).
3. Ensure cart persistence for logged-in users and temporary storage for guest users.

We'll focus on the `cart` section under the `backend` folder for these implementations.
