To implement the feature for updating existing product details with the given constraints, we need to perform the following steps based on the provided folder structure and user story:

### Implementation Plan:

1. **Extend the Product model to ensure proper validation.**
2. **Implement a service to handle the logic for updating product details.**
3. **Implement a controller to expose the API for updating products.**
4. **Update routes to include the new product management endpoint.**
5. **Create MySQL database schema if needed.**
6. **Ensure this feature works by initializing it in the application.**

### Implementation:

#### 1. Extend the Product model to ensure proper validation

The Product model already exists based on our previous implementation. We will assume the model already has the necessary fields.

#### 2. Implement a service to handle the logic for updating product details
