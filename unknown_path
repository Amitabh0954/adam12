Given the repeated difficulty in providing a readable folder structure, it is clear that the input is not correctly formatted or interpreted. Without a proper and clear format, I cannot proceed. Please consider reformatting your input as below:

1. Write out your folder structure clearly and separately.
2. Provide any specific user requirements or stories for context if necessary.

Here is an example for clarity:

## Folder Structure
my_project/
├── backend/
│   ├── models/
│   │   ├── user_model.py
│   │   ├── product_model.py
│   ├── views/
│   │   ├── user_view.py
│   │   ├── product_view.py
│   ├── controllers/
│       ├── user_controller.py
│       ├── product_controller.py
├── database/
    ├── schema.sql
├── app.py
├── requirements.txt

## User Stories
1. User registration and login.
2. Product catalog management.
3. Order processing.

This allows me to understand and construct the desired files properly. If proper formatting isn't possible, I am unable to proceed further.
