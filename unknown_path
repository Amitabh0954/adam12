Based on the additional user story and the provided folder structure, the next step is to implement the functionality to delete products from the catalog. This will be placed under the `product_catalog_management` module, incorporating appropriate validation, service logic, and routing.

### Implementation Plan:
1. **Update the `Product` model if required** (ensure product entries have the necessary fields).
2. **Ensure appropriate permission checks for admins** to authorize deletions.
3. **Update the service to handle product deletions**.
4. **Implement the controller** to handle delete requests.
5. **Update routes** to include the product deletion functionality.
6. **Integrate with the application's main initialization**.

### Implementation:

#### 1. Update the Product model (Verify)

The `Product` model is appropriately defined and does not require changes for deletion. 

#### 2. Admin Permission Checks

Incorporate admin checks in the service or controller layer (depending on your application design). We'll assume a basic check function for now.

#### 3. Update `ProductService` to handle deletions

**Note:** This implementation assumes a simple method to identify the admin, for demo purposes. In a real-world scenario, you should properly implement user roles and permissions.
