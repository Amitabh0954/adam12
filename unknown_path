Your repeated input does not provide a clear or readable folder structure, making it infeasible to generate the project files you need. Proper format and clear input are essential for me to assist you effectively. As it stands, I am unable to proceed with the information given.

Please reformat your folder structure in a clear and organized manner. An example is shown below:

my_project/
├── backend/
│   ├── models.py
│   ├── views.py
│   ├── controllers.py
├── database/
│   ├── schema.sql
├── app.py
├── requirements.txt

If you can provide a similar clear structure, I will be able to help you generate the files you need.
