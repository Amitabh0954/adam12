To implement the functionality for saving and retrieving the shopping cart state for logged-in users, we need to follow these steps:

### Implementation Plan:

1. **Extend the ShoppingCartService to handle saving the cart state to the user's profile.**
2. **Implement a controller to expose the API for saving and retrieving the cart state for logged-in users.**
3. **Update routes to include the new shopping cart management endpoint for saving and retrieving the cart state.**
4. **Update MySQL database schema to ensure the cart state is linked to the user's profile.**
5. **Ensure this feature works by initializing it in the application.**
