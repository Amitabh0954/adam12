To implement saving the cart state for logged-in users, we need to:

1. Update the Cart model to associate it with a user.
2. Modify the views to handle saving and retrieving cart state for logged-in users.
3. Ensure that the cart state is persistent across sessions for logged-in users.

We'll focus on the `cart` section under the `backend` folder for these implementations.
