To implement password recovery featuring password reset links expiring after 24 hours and email verification, additional modifications are needed. We will add:

1. A model to store password reset tokens.
2. Views to handle request and validation of password resets.
3. Update the `create_app` to include mail functionality.

Let's proceed accordingly.
