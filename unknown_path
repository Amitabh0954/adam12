To implement the functionality for removing products from the shopping cart, ensuring that the total price updates automatically and users see a confirmation before the removal, we need to follow these steps:

### Implementation Plan:

1. **Extend the ShoppingCartService to handle removing items from the cart and updating the total price.**
2. **Implement a controller to expose the API for removing items from the shopping cart with confirmation.**
3. **Update routes to include the new shopping cart management endpoint for item removal.**
4. **Ensure this feature works by initializing it in the application.**
