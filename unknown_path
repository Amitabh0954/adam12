Based on the folder structure and user stories provided, we need to implement user login functionality under the folder `backend/user_account_management`. This involves creating necessary models, services, controllers, and routes to handle user login with constraints on invalid login attempts and session timeout.

### Steps to Implement User Login Functionality:

1. **Update the User model**: Add fields for tracking login attempts and last login.
2. **Create a schema for user login**: `LoginSchema`.
3. **Implement login service**: Service method for logging in users.
4. **Implement login controller**: Controller for handling login requests.
5. **Update routes**: Include routes for login.
6. **Ensure main app initialization**: Proper integration of user account management routes.
7. **Update database schema**: Accommodate new fields.

### Implementation:

#### 1. Update the `User` model to support login attempts and session management
