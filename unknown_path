Based on your user story and the given folder structure, we need to implement password recovery functionality in the `user_account_management` module. This will involve creating and updating models, services, controllers, and routes. The password recovery process will include generating a password reset link that expires after 24 hours and email verification for identity confirmation.

### Implementation Plan:

1. **Update the User model**: Add fields for password reset token and expiration.
2. **Create a schema for password reset**: `PasswordResetSchema`.
3. **Implement password reset service**: Service methods for password recovery.
4. **Implement password reset controller**: Controller for handling password reset requests.
5. **Update routes**: Include routes for password reset.
6. **Ensure main app initialization**: Proper integration of user account management routes.
7. **Update database schema**: Accommodate new fields.

### Implementation:

#### 1. Update the `User` model for password recovery
