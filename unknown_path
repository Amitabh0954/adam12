In order to support product update functionality while adhering to the provided folder structure and user stories, we need to add the ability for an admin to update existing product details. This will include verifying appropriate updates and ensuring that only authorized personnel (i.e., admin) can perform such operations.

### Implementation Plan:
1. **Update `Product` model for any necessary fields** (ensure appropriate constraints from previous implementation).
2. **Create a schema for updating product details**: `ProductUpdateSchema`.
3. **Implement product management service**: Update service methods to handle product updates.
4. **Implement the product management controller**: Add routes/controller methods for updating product details.
5. **Update routes**: Include routes for managing product updates.

### Implementation:

#### 1. Verify the Product model (as previously defined)

The `Product` model was already defined appropriately as a starting point. Therefore, no change is needed.

#### 2. Create `ProductUpdateSchema` for validating product updates
