Based on the provided user story and folder structure, we need to implement the search functionality within the `product_catalog_management` module. This feature will allow users to search for products by names, categories, or attributes and ensure that the results are pageable.

### Implementation Plan

1. **Update the `Product` model** (ensure it includes searchable attributes).
2. **Create a schema for querying products**: `ProductSearchSchema` to validate the search queries.
3. **Implement a search service** that performs search operations.
4. **Implement the product search controller** that handles search requests.
5. **Update routes** to include product search functionality.
6. **Ensure proper integration with the main application initialization**.

### Implementation:

#### 1. Verify Product model (minimal adjustments for search attributes)

Assuming categories and attributes are part of the initial implementation, ensure the Product model includes relevant fields.

#### 2. Create `ProductSearchSchema` for validating product search queries
