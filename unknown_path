Based on the user story and the folder structure, we need to implement the functionality for adding new products to the inventory. The implementation will be placed under the `product_catalog_management` module and will involve creating and updating models, services, controllers, and routes.

### Implementation Plan:

1. **Create the Product model**: Defines the product entity.
2. **Create a schema for product management**: `ProductSchema` for validation.
3. **Implement product management service**: Service methods for adding new products.
4. **Implement product management controller**: Controller for handling product management requests.
5. **Update routes**: Include routes for managing products.
6. **Ensure main app initialization**: Proper integration and routing.
7. **Update database schema**: Add a schema file to create the products table.
