Based on your additional user story and the given folder structure, we need to implement profile management functionality under the `user_account_management` module. This will involve updating the user model to support profile updates, creating the necessary services for managing profile updates, implementing the corresponding controllers, and ensuring routes for profile management are in place.

### Implementation Plan:

1. **Update the User model**: Add fields for profile information.
2. **Create a schema for user profile updates**: `ProfileUpdateSchema`.
3. **Implement profile management service**: Service methods for managing profile updates.
4. **Implement profile management controller**: Controller for handling profile update requests.
5. **Update routes**: Include routes for profile management.
6. **Ensure main app initialization**: Proper integration of user account management routes.
7. **Update database schema**: Accommodate new fields for profile information.

### Implementation:

#### 1. Update the `User` model to include profile information
