To implement the functionality for modifying the quantity of products in the shopping cart and recalculating the total price, we need to follow these steps:

### Implementation Plan:

1. **Extend the ShoppingCartService to handle modifying quantities of items and updating the total price.**
2. **Implement a controller to expose the API for modifying quantities in the shopping cart.**
3. **Update routes to include the new shopping cart management endpoint for quantity modification.**
4. **Ensure this feature works by initializing it in the application.**
